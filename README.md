# TextProcessing-pySpark
## About

## Data
For this project, I will use a book from [Project Gutenberg] (https://www.gutenberg.org/). The book I will use is The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha Christie.
Once I find the book I will use the Plain Text version of the book. The thing about Gutenburg is they have license information at the bottom of each book. To keep that from
impacting the output of my text processing I copied and pasted the book into a notepad and removed the license information along with any other information Gutenburg added to 
the book. Once that is done I uploaded the book to Github that way I will have a URL to the book. In Github how to get the URL is to click the book in the repo then click raw or 
blame. The address in the address bar is the URL that will be used in the project.

## Databrick
For this project, I will be creating and running the code on a website called Databrick Community.
All you need to get Databrick running is to create an account. Once you have an account you go under the cluster tab and then click create a cluster.
Once a cluster is created go back to the main menu and click create a new notebook. Once for the notebook setting the language is python and for the cluster, you want to select 
the cluster you just created. Now the project is ready for code.
